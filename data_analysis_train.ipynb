So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. My favourite animal is like A beagle., right, well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you,\""

       "\"well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. so we're designing a new remote control and, as you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. and so there are three different stages to the design. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. My favourite animal is like A beagle., right, well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you,\""
